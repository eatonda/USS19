At the start of the game, you will place your ships onto locations of your
choice on a grid that you are presented with. You can arrange the ships you
place on the grid either horizontally or vertically. 

Each ship occupies a number of squares on the grid, and all ships must occupy
distinct squares (i.e. no two ships can occupy the same square). 

Once all of your ships have been placed on the grid, the game begins and
progresses in a series of rounds.

The game interface presents you both with a view of your own grid (i.e. the
grid on which you placed your ships) and a tracking grid. The tracking grid
will track which squares you have attacked on the opponent's grid. You are not
able to directly view the grid on which your opponent has placed their ships
(and likewise your opponent cannot see your grid).

In each round the following takes place:
	- you select a square on your tracking grid that you have not
	previously selected to attack.
	- your AI opponent likewise selects a square to attack on your grid.
	- the square you targeted on your tracking grid is updated. If the 
	square attacked contained a ship, the square is updated to be colored 
	red. Otherwise, the square is updated to be colored white. 
	- the square that was targeted by your opponent is likewise updated
	on your grid. If the square contained a ship, that square is updated
	to be colored red. Otherwise the square is updated to be colored 
	white.
	- if all of the squares occupied by a ship are attacked, then the ship
	  sinks (and the sinking of the ship is announced to both players).
	- once all ships of either or both players are sunk, the game ends.
	- the player whose ships have sunk loses and the other player wins.
	- if both players lose all of their ships in the same round, then the
	  game is a draw.
